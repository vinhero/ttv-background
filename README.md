# ttv-background

A Programm written in python with pygame.

It's supposed to be used as a background for your stream.

Currently it renders little Planes spawning at certain spawnpoints and traveling accross the screen.

By using a TwitchBot it gets activ chatusers and names the planes after them.

If no user is currently activ, the planes become nameless.
